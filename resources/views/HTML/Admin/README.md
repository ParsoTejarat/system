# Minton - The most complete web ui kit and dashboard template

Thank you for purchasing Minton :). The following guideline will help you to get started with Minton and its documentation.


#### Gulp

We've included Gulp file (gulpfile.js) to help you get started with theme and build automation. You'll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js. Note that the detailed instructions are available in `docs/setup.html` too.

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/). (Nodejs_v16.0.0)

To install gulp, run the following command:
```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you're done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:
```
$ yarn
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+  `gulp` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` directory and starts local server serving the theme (Default demo).

+  `gulp --demo **` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` directory and starts local server serving the theme (** = ['creative', 'corporate' 'material', 'modern', 'saas']).

+  `gulp build` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` folder (Default demo Build).

+  `gulp build --demo **` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` folder (** = ['creative', 'corporate' 'material', 'modern', 'saas'] Build).

+  `gulp clean` - delete (clean) `dist` folder. (Opation Task For CLean dist Folder)
